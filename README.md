# Sky Pixel Semantic Segmentation with approaches based on image algorithms, machine learning and CNNs + Android App

Welcome to the repository for a semantic segmentation algorithm specifically designed to identify and segment sky pixels in images. This repository also includes an Android app that showcases the implementation of the PyTorch model for semantic segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
